# LeetCode 130 ¬∑ Surrounded Regions (Medium)

**Problem Statement**

Given an `m x n` matrix `board` containing `'X'` and `'O'`, capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by `'X'`. A region is captured by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.

---

## üß† Pattern Matching

This problem is a classic **Grid + DFS/BFS traversal** problem with a twist:

- The solution requires a **reverse traversal from the border**.
- We mark `'O'`s that are **not** surrounded (i.e., connected to border) and leave them intact.
- All other `'O'`s will be turned into `'X'`.

**Key Idea**: Start DFS/BFS **from the borders** and mark all `'O'`s connected to the border with a placeholder (e.g., `'#'`).

    def solve(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> None:
        if not board: return
        rows, cols = len(board), len(board[0])

        def dfs(r, c):
            if r < 0 or c < 0 or r >= rows or c >= cols or board[r][c] != 'O':
                return
            board[r][c] = '#'  # Temporarily mark safe region
            for dr, dc in [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]:
                dfs(r + dr, c + dc)

        # Start from border cells
        for r in range(rows):

            dfs(r, cols - 1)
        for c in range(cols):
            dfs(0, c)
            dfs(rows - 1, c)

                elif board[r][c] == '#':
                    board[r][c] = 'O'

## üîç Highlights & Takeaways

- **Grid traversal** via DFS is a core skill.
- **Reverse thinking**: Start from border instead of internal cells.
- In-place marking (`'#'`) is a common trick to distinguish regions.
- Can also be solved using **BFS with queue** if stack depth is a concern.
